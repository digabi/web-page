          Abitti and the Abitti logo are EU trademarks registered by the Ministry of Education and Culture and governed
          by the Finnish Matriculation Examination Board (hereafter FMEB) under the codes 015833742 and 015838915.

          Although FMEB publishes software under open source licenses, individuals and companies do not have the right
          to use the name or brand their products “Abitti,” or to use the FMEB’s trademarks in any way on their products
          or in related advertising, except under certain limited circumstances. Doing so would cause confusion among
          examinees undertaking FMEB exams, because they may believe they are using a product produced or sponsored by
          FMEB even if it is a product of another party altogether. To address this issue, FMEB has developed the
          following guidelines for the use of FMEB’s trademarks. These guidelines are designed to serve both consumers,
          to ensure that they know the source of the products they use, and companies and other interested parties, so
          that they can avoid improperly generating confusion in the marketplace.

        <div class="section-title-space h2 blue">A. Use of the Brand “Abitti”</div>
        <div class="body">
          You may not use “Abitti” or any confusingly similar mark as a trademark for your product, or use “Abitti” in
          any other manner that might cause confusion in the marketplace, including in advertising, on auction sites, or
          on software or hardware. The only way to obtain permission to use FMEB’s trademark is by a written signed
          license agreement between FMEB and the licensee. Absolutely no exceptions. If you are a consumer of a product
          that contains the Abitti trademark, and you believe it is not an official product of FMEB, please contact
          lautakunta@ylioppilastutkinto.fi.

          The Abitti logo may not be used on any products without FMEB’s express written permission. The only way to
          obtain permission to use FMEB’s trademark is by a written signed license agreement between FMEB and the
          licensee. Absolutely no exceptions. If you are a consumer of a product that contains the Abitti logo, and you

          Are Also
          Prohibited </div>
        <div class="body">
          There is no connection between the word “Abitti” and digital exams other than the association created by
          the FMEB. FMEB has created this association by spending time and money to establish goodwill in its products,
          services and trademarks. As a result, you may not use the word “Abitti”, words with similar connotations or
          pronunciations, or other words that may cause confusion in the market as a trademark for your products.
        </div>

        <div class="section-title-space h2 blue">D. “Fair Use” of Abitti</div>
        <div class="body">
          A key element in evaluating “fair use” use of FMEB’s trademarks is whether the use is likely to cause
          confusion
          in the marketplace as to the source or sponsorship of a product. The word Abitti can be mentioned in marketing
          so long as the statement is truthful and not misleading, does not imply an improper association with or
          sponsorship by FMEB and otherwise complies with applicable laws.
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <div class="section-title-space h2 blue"> </div>
        <div class="body">
          Marketing claims such as “Abitti Compatible” to suggest that the product in question is suitable for Abitti
          use would amount to impermissible use of FMEB’s trademarks, as this gives the impression of approval by FMEB
          for the product. Instead, explanatory text such as “[The product] has been tested and found functioning with
          version ABITTI1945C of Abitti, provided that an external USB-c adapter is used.” can be used.
        </div>

      <section class="extra-bottom-margin">
        <div class="section-title-space h2 blue"> </div>
        <div class="body">
          Some examples of allowed uses include explanatory texts such as “The exams have been created for use in the
          Abitti environment” and “The service helps grading exams conducted in the Abitti environment”. If you include a
          complete and unchanged Abitti image as part of a managed workstation you can mention “This workstation contains Abitti student
          environment [provided by Matriculation Examination board]”. In this case you must communicate how the Abitti
          image will be updated by you or the 3rd party.
          <br /><br />
          Some examples of prohibited uses include, but are not limited to, product names such as “YourCompany Abitti Exams”, “Abitti
          Exam Creator” and any use of the word Abitti on logo or logo-like sign.

          <h2 class="no-bottom-margin">Publishing and Marketing Software Derived from Abitti.net </h2>
          Abitti.net is a collection of many different software programs, developed both by FMEB and other members of
          the open source community, which FMEB gathered and built to create the Abitti.net. All software programs
          included in Abitti.net are released under open source licenses. FMEB makes Abitti.net software available via
          free download on the Internet through our GitHub site. As a licensee under the applicable licenses, you have
          the right to make changes to Abitti.net software and can market and distribute those changes according to the
          terms of the license. Those changes may include making modifications to certain portions of the software,
          adding new components that were not included by FMEB, or removing components that were included by FMEB.
          <br /><br />
          Once you have made changes to the software, it is no longer the same as the original, and as a result, it is
          inappropriate to name it or brand it as though it is.
          <br /><br />
          You may not name or brand your product “Abitti”, or use the Abitti trademarks in any way, either on your
          product or in related advertising. You must use a different trademark for your product that will not cause
          confusion with the trademarks of FMEB, will not indicate or imply that your product originates from or is
          sponsored or approved by FMEB, and which otherwise complies with applicable trademark laws. Please also refer
          to the guidelines for use of the brand “Abitti” and for plays on the words “Abitti”.
          <br /><br />
          FMEB encourages you to take full advantage of your rights under the copyright licenses with respect to the
          software. However, it is important that our examinees and the public at large are easily able to determine
          which products are published by FMEB and which products are not, including modifications of Abitti.net
          software, distributed by parties unaffiliated with FMEB.
